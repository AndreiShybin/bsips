The Core Team Worker Proposal provides compensation to entities for specification and/or development of novel solutions which benefit the BitShares platform thru the BitShares Improvements Process defined below. 

## BitShares Improvements Process using BitShares Improvement Proposals (BSIP)

1.  Draft BSIP Specification
2.  Publish BSIP
3.  Vote BSIP Implementation
4.  Fund Development

## Draft BSIP Specification

Any entity intending to improve the BitShares protocol or provide informational guidance to the community is encouraged to follow the contribution guide within the [BSIP1 Purpose and Guidelines]( https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0001.md) document. The process is transparent and open, allowing anyone to participate within our [BSIPS repository](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/). Time spent drafting, reviewing and contributing to the discussion may be eligible for compensation depending on quality criteria thru the BitShares Core Team Worker Proposal. Contributors will log their time within the Issue and the Coordinator will facilitate compensation.

## Publish BSIP

Once the discussions within the Issue have defined a completed draft, The BSIP repository editor will request the author to create a pull request. This will signal to the BitShares Community that the new BSIP is ready for their review. Typically, community review is not compensated at this stage. 

## Vote BSIP implementation (yeah, nay)

Evaluation of a BSIP for `accepted` or `rejected` status is determined by the outcome of voting by the BTS token holders. Proposals for both “yeah” and “nay” are published simultaneously, tallied at expiry, then compared. The Core Team Worker Proposal has funds to compensate the BSIP author for publishing these vote proposals. 

## Fund Development 

Any protocol BSIP with the `accepted` status may proceed with development of the specification. Funding may be approved by BTS token holders by a distinct Worker Proposal or thru the Core Team Worker Proposal (at the discretion and availability of the Core Team). Coordination with the Core Team is required prior to any entity proceeding with development to ensure proper release and resource planning. The Core Team will review and test code prior to inclusion into main repository. Core Team will include implementations into the release schedule at its own discretion. All code must be developed within the [BitShares Core repository](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core) under MIT license.
